# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system developed using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and other libraries to accurately recognize and read vehicle number plates from images and video streams.

## Features

- **Real-time Number Plate Detection:** Detects number plates in real-time from video streams or images.
- **High Accuracy Recognition:** Uses advanced machine learning models to accurately recognize and extract text from number plates.
- **Multiple Format Support:** Supports multiple image and video formats for input.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for loading images or videos and displaying results.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8:** Utilized for high-performance object detection.
- **OpenCV:** Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **Tesseract OCR:** Employed for optical character recognition to read text from detected number plates.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementing the system.

## Installation

To install and run the system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/icodebest/anpr-system.git
